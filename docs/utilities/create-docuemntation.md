# Create Documentation

## Documentation Strategies

To optimize documentation in the deployment process, the following strategies have been incorporated based on the article _"Approaches for Documentation in Continuous Software Development"_ by Theo Theunissen, Stijn Hoppenbrouwers, and Sietse Overbeek (2022):

- **Just Enough Upfront Documentation:** It is recommended to generate only the essential documentation at the beginning of the deployment, focusing on the repository structure and general plan. More specific details will be documented progressively as concrete decisions are made.

- **Executable Documentation:** The use of versioned files and configurations such as _README.md_, _Dockerfiles_, _YAML_, and executable _Bash Scripts_ is encouraged.

- **Automated Text Analytics:** It is suggested to explore natural language processing (NLP) tools to extract relevant information from Git commits, infrastructure files, and other sources, reducing the need for extensive manual documentation. For example, AI tools like ChatGPT.
